# Baza motyw√≥w

I was preparing for my high school leaving exam but I couldn't just stop coding and focus on learning of boring things. I created an application that can help you prepare for the Polish exam. It contains a list of motifs from books, movies, series and others that you can use in your essay. Everyone can suggest own motif. I used MEVN Stack. I also found interesting CSS framework for Vue (Vuetify) and I decided to try it out.
